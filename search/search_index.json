First, start by importing flumine/bflw and creating a trading and framework client: import betfairlightweight from flumine import Flumine , clients trading = betfairlightweight . APIClient ( \"username\" ) client = clients . BetfairClient ( trading ) framework = Flumine ( client = client ) Note flumine will handle login, logout and keep alive whilst the framework is running using the keep_alive worker. A strategy can now be created by using the BaseStrategy class: from flumine import BaseStrategy class ExampleStrategy ( BaseStrategy ): def start ( self ): # subscribe to streams print ( \"starting strategy 'ExampleStrategy'\" ) def check_market_book ( self , market , market_book ): # process_market_book only executed if this returns True if market_book . status != \"CLOSED\" : return True def process_market_book ( self , market , market_book ): # process marketBook object print ( market_book . status ) This strategy can now be initiated with the market and data filter before being added to the framework: from betfairlightweight.filters import ( streaming_market_filter , streaming_market_data_filter , ) strategy = ExampleStrategy ( market_filter = streaming_market_filter ( event_type_ids = [ \"7\" ], country_codes = [ \"GB\" ], market_types = [ \"WIN\" ], ), market_data_filter = streaming_market_data_filter ( fields = [ \"EX_ALL_OFFERS\" ]) ) framework . add_strategy ( strategy ) The framework can now be started: framework . run () Stream class By default the stream class will be a MarketStream which provides a MarketBook python object, if collecting data this can be changed to a DataStream class however process_raw_data will be called and not process_market_book: from flumine import BaseStrategy from flumine.streams.datastream import DataStream class ExampleDataStrategy ( BaseStrategy ): def process_raw_data ( self , publish_time , data ): print ( publish_time , data ) strategy = ExampleDataStrategy ( market_filter = streaming_market_filter ( event_type_ids = [ \"7\" ], country_codes = [ \"GB\" ], market_types = [ \"WIN\" ], ), stream_class = DataStream ) flumine . add_strategy ( strategy ) Paper Trading Flumine can be used to paper trade strategies live using the following code: import betfairlightweight from flumine import Flumine , clients trading = betfairlightweight . APIClient ( \"username\" ) client = clients . BetfairClient ( trading , paper_trade = True ) framework = Flumine ( client = client ) strategy = ExampleStrategy ( market_filter = { \"markets\" : [ \"/tmp/marketdata/1.170212754\" ]} ) framework . add_strategy ( strategy ) framework . run () Market data will be recieved as per live but any orders will use Simulated execution and Simulated order polling to replicate live trading. Tip This can be handy when testing strategies as the betfair website can be used to validate the market. Backtesting Flumine can be used to backtest strategies using the following code: from flumine import FlumineBacktest , clients client = clients . BacktestClient () framework = FlumineBacktest ( client = client ) strategy = ExampleStrategy ( market_filter = { \"markets\" : [ \"/tmp/marketdata/1.170212754\" ]} ) framework . add_strategy ( strategy ) framework . run () Note the use of market filter to pass the file directories. Sometimes a subset of the market lifetime is required, this can be optimised by limiting the number of updates to process resulting in faster backtesting: strategy = ExampleStrategy ( market_filter = { \"markets\" : [ \"/tmp/marketdata/1.170212754\" ], \"listener_kwargs\" : { \"inplay\" : False , \"seconds_to_start\" : 600 }, } ) The extra kwargs above will limit processing to preplay in the final 10 minutes. Tip Multiple strategies and markets can be passed, flumine will pass the MarketBooks to the correct strategy via its subscription. Backtesting uses the SimulatedExecution execution class and tries to accurately simulate matching with the following: Place/Cancel/Replace latency delay added BetDelay added based on market Queue positioning based on liquidity available Limitations: Queue cancellations Double counting of liquidity","title":"QuickStart"},{"location":"quickstart/#quickstart","text":"","title":"QuickStart"},{"location":"quickstart/#live","text":"Tip flumine uses betfairlightweight for communicating with the Betfair API, please see docs for how to use/setup before proceeding.

Sometimes a subset of the market lifetime is required, this can be optimised by limiting the number of updates to process resulting in faster backtesting: strategy = ExampleStrategy ( market_filter = { \"markets\" : [ \"/tmp/marketdata/1.170212754\" ], \"listener_kwargs\" : { \"inplay\" : False , \"seconds_to_start\" : 600 }, } ) The extra kwargs above will limit processing to preplay in the final 10 minutes. Tip Multiple strategies and markets can be passed, flumine will pass the MarketBooks to the correct strategy via its subscription.
